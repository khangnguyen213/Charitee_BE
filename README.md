# CHARITEE - Front-end

This is the website I made for my capstone project in the web-fullstack course. The website was developed with the purpose of helping charitable organizations collect donations from the community conveniently and quickly. At the same time, Charitee also helps users find ongoing charities and participate in charitable activities.

This repository only includes the back-end part of my website. You can visit the front-end part [here](https://github.com/khangnguyen213/Charitee_FE).

Technologies I used include:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS framework

I also used:

- SendGrid (for sending verification email)
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken
- MongoDB (using Mongoose)
- Paypal

The design of this website I gathered from the internet and not from my idea.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the website in your local

```bash
npm start
```
